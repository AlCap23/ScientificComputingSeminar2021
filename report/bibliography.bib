  title       = {Julia: {A} {Fresh} {Approach} to {Numerical} {Computing}},
  abstract    = {Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from the diverse fields of computer science and computational science to create a new approach to numerical computing. Julia is designed to be easy and fast. Julia questions notions generally held as "laws of nature" by practitioners of numerical computing: 1. High-level dynamic programs have to be slow. 2. One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment, and 3. There are parts of a system for the programmer, and other parts best left untouched as they are built by the experts. We introduce the Julia programming language and its design --- a dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming. Julia shows that one can have machine performance without sacrificing human convenience.},

  abstract     = {DifferentialEquations.jl is a package for solving differential equations in Julia. It covers discrete equations (function maps, discrete stochastic (Gillespie/Markov) simulations), ordinary differential equations, stochastic differential equations, algebraic differential equations, delay differential equations, hybrid differential equations, jump diffusions, and (stochastic) partial differential equations. Through extensive use of multiple dispatch, metaprogramming, plot recipes, foreign function interfaces (FFI), and call-overloading, DifferentialEquations.jl offers a unified user interface to solve and analyze various forms of differential equations while not sacrificing features or performance. Many modern features are integrated into the solvers, such as allowing arbitrary user-defined number systems for high-precision and arithmetic with physical units, built-in multithreading and parallelism, and symbolic calculation of Jacobians. Integrated into the package is an algorithm testing and benchmarking suite to both ensure accuracy and serve as an easy way for researchers to develop and distribute their own methods. Together, these features build a highly extendable suite which is feature-rich and highly performant.

  abstract     = {Recently, compressed sensing (CS) has aroused much attention for that sparse signals can be retrieved from a small set of linear samples. Algorithms for CS reconstruction can be roughly classified into two categories: (1) optimization-based algorithms and (2) greedy search ones. In this paper, we propose an algorithm called the preconditioned generalized orthogonal matching pursuit (Pre-gOMP) to promote the recovery performance. We provide a sufficient condition for exact recovery via the Pre-gOMP algorithm, which says that if the mutual coherence of the preconditioned sampling matrix Φ satisfies \$ {\textbackslash}mu (\{{\textbackslash}Phi \}) {\textless} {\textbackslash}frac \{1\}\{SK -S + 1\}, \$ then the Pre-gOMP algorithm exactly recovers any K-sparse signals from the compressed samples, where S ({\textgreater}1) is the number of indices selected in each iteration of Pre-gOMP. We also apply the Pre-gOMP algorithm to the application of ghost imaging. Our experimental results demonstrate that the Pre-gOMP can largely improve the imaging quality of ghost imaging, while boosting the imaging speed.},

to support transparent, lifelongprogram analysis and transformation for arbitrary
programs,by providing high-level information to compilertransformations at compile-time,
link-time, run-time, and inidle time between runs.LLVM defines a common, low-levelcode
representation in Static Single Assignment (SSA) form,with several novel features:
a simple, language-independenttype-system that exposes the primitives commonly used
toimplement high-level language features; an instruction fortyped address arithmetic;
and a simple mechanism that canbe used to implement the exception handling features
ofhigh-level languages (and setjmp/longjmp in C) uniformlyand efficiently.The LLVM
compiler framework and coderepresentation together provide a combination of key capabilitiesthat
are important for practical, lifelong analysis andtransformation of programs.To our
knowledge, no existingcompilation approach provides all these capabilities.We describethe
design of the LLVM representation and compilerframework, and evaluate the design in
three ways: (a) thesize and effectiveness of the representation, including thetype
information it provides; (b) compiler performance forseveral interprocedural problems;
and (c) illustrative examplesof the benefits LLVM provides for several challengingcompiler
problems.},
